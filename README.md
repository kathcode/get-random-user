# Get random user

This project was created to show you how easy is to create
a simple application with **Framework Angular (v=9.1.0)**
using the OPEN API **https://randomuser.me/** to get the users.

You can see the implementation of **TypeScript** in all the variables
and functions that I created. It would be easy to understand.

## To run the application

```
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```
